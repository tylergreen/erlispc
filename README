erlispc is a experimental compiler for generating erlang code from an minimal and extensible lisp scripting language.

Goals: 
Straightforward
Simple
Small       

High Level Challenges: 
1) how to use erlangs own list manipulation functions for metaprogramming
  (or, how to avoid writing another stdprelude by hand)
2) Data structure design (tuples, lists)


To Do:

add spawn primitive
output to file
start using/testing
figure out how macros are going to work
Factor boilerplate from parser
